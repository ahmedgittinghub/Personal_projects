# ETL Group Project

## Introduction
This project aims to automate the ETL process for a fictional cafe, where data is received in CSV format and instantly transformed and loaded into normalized tables in a database.

## Overview
The project is divided into two sprints.

## Sprint 1:
This sprint focuses on developing functions to extract data from CSV files and load them into a local MySQL database.

## Sprint 2:
Sprint 2 is divided into two phases:
   - Phase 1: Shifts the project from a MySQL database to a PostgreSQL Database, facilitating easier migration to AWS Redshift.
   - Phase 2: Executes the transition of the ETL process, involving code to extract and load data into an AWS Redshift database.
